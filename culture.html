        <h2>Culture</h2>
		<p>
            Dominicut has quite an industrial/militarized culture. Wether you're still in primary school, or in a retirement home, you are learning about the national military or a job that helps the military (Arms Manufacturing, etc.)
            We also have a very strong fishing sector, with the majority of citizens reporting they fish "at least one per week." This, along with large companies fishing in the ocean, is why Dominicut has the best trout fishing sector in WakaNations.
            This industry also helps us fund our military, so it all comes full circle.
