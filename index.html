			The Strong Military State of Dominicut is a massive, socially progressive nation, notable for its infamous sell-swords, compulsory military service, and punitive income tax rates. The hard-nosed population of 1.223 billion Dominicutians have some civil rights, but not too many, enjoy the freedom to spend their money however they like, to a point, and take part in free and open elections, although not too often.

			The large government juggles the competing demands of Defense, Law & Order, and Administration. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of CL-ZG-01. The average income tax rate is 66.0%, and even higher for the wealthy.
			
			The all-consuming Dominicutian economy, worth 104 trillion dollars a year, is quite specialized and led by the Trout Farming industry, with significant contributions from Arms Manufacturing, Information Technology, and Beef-Based Agriculture. State-owned companies are common. Average income is 85,176 dollars, and distributed extremely evenly, with little difference between the richest and poorest citizens.
			
			Police regularly arrest families playing Monopoly, family isn't who you're born with but who you abandon in foreign countries, Dominicut has been recently classified as an international menace after 'liberating' several nearby territories, and school lockers are filled with fancy underwear. Crime is totally unknown, thanks to a well-funded police force and progressive social policies in education and welfare. Dominicut's national animal is the kiwi, which is also the nation's favorite main course.
