This will be a site that procedurally generates maps which could be used to generate new planets for space exploration in the online game "Nation States".
It would have a fog of war feature which means the map uncovers more and more the more the nation that landed on the planet explores it.
It would also be pretty customizable with sliders that change the generation (how much water, resources, size, etc.).
