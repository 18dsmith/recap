        <h2>Military</h2>
		<p>
            Dominicut focuses the majority of its spending on it's military. It is also compulsory for all those aged over 18 to take part in at least 2 years of military service. Because of this, Dominicut has one of the, if not the most manpower in WakaNations.
            The military also has a variety of Virtual Reality tech, designed to help make training soldiers and pilots a lot cheaper, and more fun. This tech comes from the research undertaken between Dominicut and Bungquat.
            The list of planes currently in service in Dominicut can be found <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=dominicut/detail=factbook/id=1549010">here</a>.
